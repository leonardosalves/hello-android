The [Rdio Android SDK](http://www.rdio.com/developers/docs/libraries/android/) lets developers call the web service API, authenticate
users, and play full song streams or 30 second samples.

To get started:

* Get a OAuth 2.0 client ID and secret from http://developer.rdio.com
* Clone the sample app https://github.com/rdio/hello-android
*Yncomment and change the `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDIRECT_URI` variables
* Build & enjoy
